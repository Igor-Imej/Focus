how to use tailwind:
To install Tailwind CLI without npm, you can use the standalone CLI build. This allows you to use the full power of Tailwind CLI in a self-contained executable, without requiring Node.js or npm tailwindcss.com.

Here are the steps to install and use Tailwind CLI without npm:

Download the Standalone CLI: Visit the official Tailwind CSS page and download the standalone CLI build that matches your system stackoverflow.com.
Place the Executable: Place the downloaded executable in your project directory. You can rename it to tailwindcss for simplicity dev.to.
Initialize Tailwind: Run the command ./tailwindcss init to initialize Tailwind in your project. This will create a tailwind.config.js file in your project directory dev.to.
Configure the tailwind.config.js File: Modify the content: [] field in the tailwind.config.js file to specify which directories to look in for Tailwind classes. For example, if you have your HTML and JavaScript files in a src directory, you would set content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"] dev.to.
Create an Input CSS File: Create a CSS file (for example, input.css) and add the Tailwind directives to it:
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
This file will be the input for the Tailwind CLI tailwindcss.com.

Run the Tailwind CLI Build Process: Use the command ./tailwind -i ./path/to/input.css -o ./path/to/output.css --watch to start the Tailwind CLI build process. Replace ./path/to/input.css with the path to your input CSS file and ./path/to/output.css with the path where you want the output CSS file to be saved. The --watch flag will make the CLI watch your input file for changes and rebuild the output file whenever changes are detected dev.to.
Use the Output CSS File: Finally, include the output CSS file in your HTML file to use Tailwind CSS in your project.
Remember that the standalone CLI build of Tailwind does not support all features of Tailwind. For example, you can't use any directives like @apply, @variants, etc. To take full advantage of Tailwind's features, it's recommended to install it via npm v2.tailwindcss.com.


when to run: ./tailwindcss -i ./website/static/css/src/input.css -o ./website/static/css/src/output.css --watch
1. Initial Development: When you're starting to develop your project, you should run this command. This will start the Tailwind CLI in watch mode, which means it will automatically rebuild your CSS whenever you make changes to your input CSS file or your Tailwind configuration testdriven.io.
2. Updating Tailwind Configuration: If you make changes to your tailwind.config.js file, you should restart the Tailwind CLI to make sure your changes take effect. This is because the CLI reads the configuration file when it starts, so any changes you make won't be recognized until you restart the CLI dev.to.
3. Adding or Removing Tailwind Directives: If you add or remove Tailwind directives in your input CSS file, you should restart the Tailwind CLI to make sure your changes are included in the output CSS file section.io.

if tailwinds gives cancer and refuses to work do this:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@import "tailwind/css/base";
@import "tailwind/css/components";
@import "tailwind/css/utilities";
